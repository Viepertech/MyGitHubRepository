/*
1. Write a java program that declares a 2D array with the following values and display the array row by row.
	Input:
          {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9},{10,11,12}}

	Output:
              1     2     3
              4     5     6
              7     8     9
              10    11    12

This Program will be my submission for question 1 for the Week:01 lab:Extra
